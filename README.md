## Project Idea
## **Safety Quotient Predictor**
### Abstract
People keep relocating to new places due to change of jobs, schools, or other reasons. Safety has been one of the crucial factor involved in deciding to live in a locality. In the recent past, there has been an upsurge in crimes in the bay area. It is often difficult for people to consider the safety of the location due to unavailability of tools to evaluate the trend of crimes and predict if the safety of the place would be favorable during their stay for x number of years in the area. Most of the tools available in the market show recent data, which would be dynamic based on the trends and hence cannot be utilized effectively to predict how the crime rates will look in the next x number of years. Thus, there is a need for an application which would predict the safety value of the locality based on the past history of crimes in and surrounding the location. The application will facilitate the renters and home buyers to make better decision to relocate to the area.

Resources: Public data sets.
